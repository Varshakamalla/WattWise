‚ö° WattWise: Smart Energy Forecasting and Grid Load Optimization System
WattWise is an intelligent energy management system that leverages machine learning to forecast energy consumption and optimize power grid load distribution. Built using Django and TensorFlow, this project promotes efficient energy usage and reduces peak-time overloads through predictive analytics and load optimization strategies.

üîç Key Features
Energy Forecasting with CNN + BiLSTM: Predict future energy consumption using a deep learning model trained on time series data including weather, appliance usage, occupancy, and more.

Grid Load Optimization: Analyze current and historical usage to detect peak hours and provide load-shifting suggestions.

Interactive Dashboard: Visualize energy consumption trends (daily, hourly, weekly) with dynamic graphs and charts.

Single & Bulk Prediction: Submit data through forms or upload CSV files to get energy predictions and insights.

Full Stack Django App: Uses Django views, templates, and models to deliver a complete web-based interface.

üß† Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (via Django Templates)

Backend: Django (Python)

ML/AI: TensorFlow (CNN + BiLSTM model)

Database: MySQL

Deployment: Google Colab for model training, .h5 model for real-time prediction
